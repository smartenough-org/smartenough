* SmartEnough
SmartEnough is an open source smart home solution that combines affordable
off-the-shelf hardware with a robust software architecture. Built for people
that don't want to pay premium for each IO they add to the system, who want to
trust the system's reliability and who are not afraid of some tinkering.

** SmartEnough design goals
- Extra cheap hardware: doable by hand (soldering iron or breadboard) and
  upgradable to something more sturdy with ordered PCBs. 48+ IO per single board
  possible and way cheaper $/IO than in any available commercial solutions.
- Robust, resiliant, secure: communication and power over twisted pair cables -
  no batteries, no radio, no cloud.
- Supports house wiring in "constellation of star topologies". We don't have a
  device in each light switch or socket, but neither are we limited to a single
  central control point. Cables from lights/shutters and switches should meet
  somewhere in one or more electrical boxes that are connected together with a
  twisted pair cable to form a CAN bus. Bus can span multiple devices in single
  electrical box, or connect multiple points in a bus or semi-bus configuration.
- Instant response to input.
- Event on one board can cause an action on another (eg. stair switches) via a
  bus without requiring a computer and HomeAssistant - eg. stair lighting.
- Can gather door/window/movement sensor data and be used as an alarm system.
- Open & customizable: I'm building it to suit my needs, trying to keep it open
  for any additional sensible functions.
- Integrates with HomeAssistant, but can do a lot without it.

** Resources
The core system software is in two repositories:
- [[https://github.com/smartenough-org/io-ctrl][io-ctrl]]:
  Firmware for IO controller board that handles IO - reads switches and
  sensors, changes outputs. Contains also firmware for hardware part (left side)
  of =CAN<->USB<->MQTT= bridge to talk to HomeAssistant.
- [[https://github.com/smartenough-org/io-gate][io-gate]]:
  computer part of =CAN<->USB<->MQT= bridge (right part) to convert CAN
  messages to MQTT events that can be understood by HomeAssistant.
- Firmware is in Rust, written with Embassy framework for STM32G431 device.
  Should migrate easy enough to other chips assuming enough peripherals are
  available (CAN and USB working together, 128kB+ Flash, 32kB+ RAM).

Rest of the resources include:
- KiCAD (schematic + board) designs for IO controller board (can be used for
  gate as well).
- KiCAD for organized power injection with protection.
- KiCAD for additional ESPHOME boards for less critical components (like
  temperature sensors).
- 3D printing (FreeCad) designs for DIN rail (mount in electrical boxes) and
  other project boxes for boards (OpenSCAD).
- This repository in addition can contain anything smarthome related I might
  publish (eg. some micropython watering experiments)

** Example deployment
[[media/deployment-diagram.png]]

That's my currently working deployment. NOTE: CAN should not be a star, it
should be a bus. Hence in one case I send CAN signal back over another cable
pair in the same cable to "flatten" it out. Bus gets longer (it's around 50m
total), but stubs are shorter.

I use two pairs for power, one for CAN and one for optional CAN return and a bit
weird RJ45 wiring to indicate the cable is a "SMART" cable not Ethernet. I also
mark those in a visible way. Anything will work as long as CAN and FORWARD is in
the same twisted pair (my mapping will work with normal T568B too).

| T568B | CAN  |   |                       |
|-------+------+---+-----------------------|
| w-o   | w-o  | 1 | CAN_L                 |
| o     | o    | 2 | CAN_H                 |
| w-g   | w-g  | 3 | IN POWER, 24V         |
| bl    | g    | 4 | IN POWER, GND (swap!) |
| w-bl  | w-bl | 5 | IN POWER, 24V         |
| g     | bl   | 6 | IN POWER, GND (swap!) |
| w-br  | w-br | 7 | CAN_L FORWARD         |
| br    | br   | 8 | CAN_H FORWARD         |


** IO Controller MainBoard
For details on components and software see
[[https://github.com/smartenough-org/io-ctrl][io-ctrl]].

This board controls IOs when paired with some relay/SSR module. It sits in an
electrical box where it can read signals from light switches and control power
to lighting. It's talks with the world via classical twisted pair cable: CAT5e
UTP. Cable carries power (24V+) and a CAN bus.

** Power distribution board
Power board distributes power with some protection (capacitors, resettable
individual fuses, main fuses, zener diodes to limit voltage, diodes to prevent
invalid polarization). It also connects CAN BUS together in configured various
ways (directly, or using FORWARD pair). In general it allows me to connect the
cables from boards in the main central hub easily.

** Greenfinger

Automatic plant watering using ESP8266 (or ESP32) using Micropython.
Integrates with HomeAssistant over MQTT:
- Reports status (humidity, operations).
- Can be controlled over MQTT (more water NOW).

It was 100% stable during a period of about a year. Plants died for unrelated
reasons. ;)
